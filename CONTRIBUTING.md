## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use Black for code formatting: `black caidence/`
- Use flake8 for linting: `flake8 caidence/`
- Add type hints for function signatures
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes

### Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting: `pytest`
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Include both unit tests and integration tests

### Documentation
- Update README.md for any new features
- Add docstrings to all public APIs
- Update type hints and schemas
- Include examples for new functionality

### Security Considerations
- Never commit PHI or sensitive data
- Follow HIPAA compliance guidelines
- Use local LLMs for PHI processing
- Implement proper access controls

## Submitting Changes

1. **Create an Issue**: For bugs or feature requests, create an issue first
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a feature branch from main
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes with tests
4. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass and code follows style guidelines
5. **Commit**: Make atomic commits with clear messages
6. **Pull Request**: Create a PR with a clear description

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Example:
```
feat(agent): add support for custom entity extraction

Add ability to specify custom entities for extraction in addition
to standard cTAKES entities.

Closes #123
```

### Pull Request Process
1. Update documentation for any new features
2. Add tests for bug fixes and new features
3. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution
4. Link any relevant issues
5. Request review from maintainers

## Tool Development

To contribute a new tool:

1. Inherit from `BaseTool` class
2. Implement required methods: `initialize()`, `execute()`, `get_schema()`
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Document the tool's purpose and usage
5. Register the tool in the tool registry

Example:
```python
from caidence.tools import BaseTool, ToolResult

class MyTool(BaseTool):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="my_tool",
            description="Description of what the tool does"
        )
    
    def initialize(self) -> bool:
        # Setup code
        return True
    
    def execute(self, parameters: dict) -> ToolResult:
        # Implementation
        return ToolResult(success=True, data=result)
    
    def get_schema(self) -> dict:
        # Parameter schema
        return {...}
```

## Release Process
