For development or custom deployments:

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/sonishsivarajkumar/cAIdence.git
cd cAIdence
./scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Run the application
python -m caidence.main
```

## üìù Your First Analysis

Let's walk through analyzing a clinical document step by step.

### Step 1: Access the Interface

1. Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser
2. You'll see the cAIdence welcome screen
3. Navigate to the "Chat Interface" tab

### Step 2: Upload a Document (Optional)

If you have clinical documents, upload them via the "Data Analysis" tab:

1. Click "Data Analysis" in the sidebar
2. Use the file uploader to add documents
3. Supported formats: .txt, .pdf, .docx

### Step 3: Ask Your First Question

In the chat interface, try these example queries:

#### Example 1: Basic Entity Search
```
Find all mentions of diabetes in the uploaded documents.
```

#### Example 2: Complex Query with Negation
```
Find surgical notes that mention arterial graft but do not mention infection or complications.
```

#### Example 3: Temporal Analysis
```
Show me all discharge summaries from the last month that mention medication changes.
```

### Step 4: Understand the Results

cAIdence will:

1. **Parse your query** and show its understanding
2. **Create an execution plan** with step-by-step actions
3. **Execute the analysis** using appropriate tools
4. **Present results** with:
   - Summary statistics
   - Extracted entities
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Detailed findings

### Step 5: Explore Visualizations

Click on the "Dashboard" tab to see:
- Entity frequency charts
- Document timelines
- Co-occurrence networks
- Statistical summaries

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Edit `config/config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
# Application settings
app:
  name: "My Clinical NLP"
  debug: false

# cTAKES configuration
ctakes:
  java_heap_size: "4G"
  timeout: 300

# Security settings
security:
  phi_protection: true
  local_llm_only: true
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for sensitive settings:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/caidence

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
PHI_PROTECTION_ENABLED=true

# LLM
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
DEFAULT_MODEL=llama2
```

## üìä Understanding Results

### Entity Extraction Results

When cAIdence processes clinical text, it identifies:

- **Medical Concepts**: Diseases, symptoms, procedures
- **Medications**: Drug names, dosages, frequencies
- **Anatomy**: Body parts, organ systems
- **Temporal Information**: Dates, time periods
- **Negations**: What is explicitly NOT present

### Confidence Scores

Each extracted entity includes:
- **Confidence**: How certain the system is (0.0-1.0)
- **Context**: Surrounding text for verification
- **Source**: Which tool or model made the extraction

### Visualization Types

cAIdence creates several types of visualizations:

1. **Bar Charts**: Entity frequency distributions
2. **Pie Charts**: Category breakdowns
3. **Timelines**: Temporal patterns in documents
4. **Heatmaps**: Co-occurrence matrices
5. **Network Graphs**: Entity relationships (coming soon)

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Use Cases

### Clinical Research

**Use Case**: Identify patients for clinical trial enrollment

```
Find all patients with Type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin therapy and have HbA1c > 7.0
```

**Result**: List of matching patients with supporting documentation

### Quality Improvement

**Use Case**: Analyze medication adherence documentation

```
Find discharge summaries where medication adherence is discussed but compliance issues are mentioned
```

**Result**: Patterns of adherence problems and interventions

### Administrative Analysis

**Use Case**: Track surgical complications

```
Find all surgical notes from the last quarter that mention post-operative complications
```

**Result**: Complication rates and types by procedure

### Educational Analysis

**Use Case**: Study clinical documentation patterns

```
Compare the language used in cardiology notes versus endocrinology notes
```

**Result**: Vocabulary differences and specialization patterns

## üîç Advanced Features

### Custom Entity Recognition

Add your own medical concepts:

```python
# In your custom tool
custom_entities = [
    "custom_medication_name",
    "specific_procedure_type",
    "organization_specific_term"
]
```

### Query Templates

Save frequently used queries:

```yaml
# config/query_templates.yaml
templates:
  medication_review: "Find all notes mentioning medication changes in the last {days} days"
  adverse_events: "Find mentions of {drug_name} with adverse reactions or side effects"
```

### Batch Processing

Process multiple documents:

```python
from caidence import CaidenceAgent

agent = CaidenceAgent()
results = agent.batch_analyze(documents, query)
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### cTAKES Not Found
```bash
# Check cTAKES installation
ls $CTAKES_PATH
java -version

# Reinstall if needed
./scripts/setup.sh
```

#### Database Connection Failed
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL status
docker-compose ps

# Reset database
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Out of Memory
```bash
# Increase Java heap size
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx8g"

# Or edit config/config.yaml
ctakes:
  java_heap_size: "8G"
```

#### Slow Performance
```bash
# Check resource usage
docker stats

# Enable caching
redis-cli ping

# Optimize queries
# Use more specific search terms
```
